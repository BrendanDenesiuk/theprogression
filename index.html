            A book is not a case of words, nor a
            bag of words, nor a bearer of words.
            A book is a space-time sequence . . .

            <i><b>The Progression</b></i> is a typographic bookwork about the creation
            of the Universe itself, told through a meta-narrative where the
            elements of the text itself become more & more realized as the story
            progresses. Our characters discuss various aspects of their yet-
            to-be-created reality, as the book slowly gains form around them:
            shifting from disjointed gibberish, to floating phrases, to a
            conventionally formatted book, save for certain attributes.

            The story begins with several black pages, reflecting the emp-
            tiness of pre-existence. This is followed by the slow build-up of

            “stars”, before, suddenly, every inch of the page becomes covered

            in overlapping & overwhelming nonsensical words, showing re-
            ality in its earliest potential stages, before any sort of rules or phys-
            ics been established. Soon after, a single voice finds clarity in the

            chaos—& the narrative commences.
