            A book is not a case of words, nor a
            bag of words, nor a bearer of words.
            A book is a space-time sequence . . .

            <i><b>The Progression</b></i> is a typographic bookwork about the creation
            of the Universe itself, told through a meta-narrative where the
            elements of the text itself become more & more realized as the story
            progresses. Our characters discuss various aspects of their yet-
            to-be-created reality, as the book slowly gains form around them:
            shifting from disjointed gibberish, to floating phrases, to a
            conventionally formatted book, save for certain attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story begins with several black pages, reflecting the emptiness
            of pre-existence. This is followed by the slow build-up of
            “stars”, before, suddenly, every inch of the page becomes covered
            in overlapping & overwhelming nonsensical words, showing reality
            in its earliest potential stages, before any sort of rules or physics
            been established. Soon after, a single voice finds clarity in the
            chaos—& the narrative commences.

            The story was written & designed simultaneously, with each page’s
            typography specifically designed to reflect its written content:
            creating a blend between visual & literary storytelling.
        </p>
        <p style='text-align: right'>
            Each of the three characters within the narrative is initially differentiated
            by shades of white & slight variations in typeface (Register,
            Fournier, & Bulmer). As the narrative progresses, a narrator joins in,
            & all characters begin speaking with register; becoming unified as
            they transition from speaking in disembodied
            phrases to properly formatted dialogue.
        </p>

            The text itself is set in white on black, to help provide a “space”
            theme, to help emphasize the creation of the universe itself. This
            project works to show the capabilities of expressive typesetting
            when placed in tandem with original writing; very simple & quiet
            page designs pair with overwhelming & complex spreads to
            create an engaging, visual narrative.

            The narrative concludes with more voices suddenly popping
            into reality, speaking out of turn & overtop of one another,
            disagreeing & agreeing all the same, until they finally come to a
            decision: to create the universe as we know it. This shift is reflected
            via a dramatic shift in the design: with the sudden appearance of

            3D typographic structures & the sudden inclusion of color-giving
            the feeling that the confines of the book have been shattered,
            & reality has truly begun to form. These structures were
            created using the same gibberish from the start of the text,
            applied as a texture to a 3D shape created in Adobe Illustrator.
